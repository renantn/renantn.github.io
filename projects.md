In leading the IsoFarm project, I orchestrated the development of a dynamic web portal tailored for the comprehensive management of agricultural applications. Utilizing file uploads from Agres equipment, IsoFarm allows for a thorough evaluation of diverse agricultural operations. It encompasses features such as speed maps, application details, and the ability to review completed tasks through replays. Beyond these features, IsoFarm provides field-specific weather forecasts and real-time monitoring capabilities for machine operations. This project showcases my leadership in leveraging technology to enhance agricultural efficiency.

## IsoLink - Telematics for AG Machines

As the team lead for Telematics, I spearheaded the development of an embedded module directly installed on machines, capturing crucial data from the machine bus. This module seamlessly integrates with IsoFarm and IsoView, enabling real-time monitoring of equipment functionality and operator activities. This is technology for efficient monitoring and control of agricultural machinery.

## IsoView - Machine Virtual Guide for AG Applications

As a key contributor to IsoView, I played a crucial part in creating support for multi-language functionality within a memory-constrained embedded system, along with overseeing the overall codebase maintenance. IsoView significantly enhances operational efficiency by providing precise control over product application in the field, navigating parallel trajectories and supporting a spectrum of field operations. Beyond its primary function, IsoView ensures optimal liquid input application, strategically preventing overlaps.

## Irrigation Management App

Within this team, I was responsible the development of a mobile app for a precision irrigation management system designed specifically for vineyards. My responsibilities included the creation of a seamlessly integrated mobile application with a telemetry system attached to the irrigation network. This system enables real-time monitoring of irrigation activities, timely fault detection, and alerts for weather conditions.
